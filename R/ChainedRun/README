This explains how to deal with chained GLM runs. 

--Why is it so weird?
One of the challenges of writing this kind of code is that 
often, we want to be able to run it on Condor. But Condor is 
a drastically different environment. Therefore, the code that
is written to work on Condor often can be a bit awkward to 
use on the desktop. 

--What is here?
There are two key pieces of code. 

---run.chained.GLM.R
This takes a set of input files (*.nml, driver file, info
on ice on/off) and runs the model by open water season. 

---output.cal.chained.R
This reads the results of the 
chained run and matches the calibration water temp data
(in cal.in.csv) and outputs a file with the combined 
results (cal.out.csv) which include both modeled and
observed temperatures. 

--How does it work? 
It generally wants to live within a directory which contains all 
the key input. The files it is looking for are:

---glm.nml
The run GLM file. This should be setup normally to run the full
timeseries. It should also be setup with input parameters and whatnot
though they could be changed on the fly if one wanted.

---icecal.in.csv
This contains the ice on/off dates. If we don't have both an on and
off date for a season, that season will *not* be run. Please see
example for required format.

---cal.in.csv
This is the calibration/validation water temp observations. Please see
example for required format.

--Why are the rGLM library files included here?
Because I didn't want to deal with relative path issues or changing version 
issues at this moment. They are copied without change, so they could always 
be updated in the future.
